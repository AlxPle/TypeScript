# Personal TypeScript Learning Repository

This repository is for my personal learning and practice with TypeScript.

## Goals
- Learn TypeScript setup, configuration, and tooling (`tsc`, `tsconfig.json`, `ts-node`).
- Understand the type system: annotations, inference, primitives, special types, tuples.
- Master interfaces, type aliases, unions, enums, and type narrowing.
- Use generics, constraints, and advanced type patterns confidently.
- Explore advanced types: mapped types, conditional types, template literal types, utility types.
- Learn modules, declaration files (`.d.ts`), DefinitelyTyped, and module augmentation.
- Understand decorators (TC39 Stage 3 and experimental).
- Apply TypeScript with the DOM, Node.js, React, and modern build tools.
- Build practical projects to reinforce learning (REST API, React app, CLI tool, type challenges).
